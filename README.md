Once the user clicks the start button, the game begins. You control a spaceship located at the bottom of the screen, able to move left, right, up, and down using the keyboard (w/a/s/d). The space invaders are positioned at the top of the screen, trying to reach the bottom (your territory). Your objective is to prevent the invaders from reaching the bottom while avoiding their shots.

As you destroy invaders, their numbers increase, and with each level and passing second, you earn points. The game also awards health points for each level completed. The saved result of each game includes the following parameters:

After finishing a game, users can view the top scores from other players in the main menu, check their position in the leaderboard, and review their individual results.
